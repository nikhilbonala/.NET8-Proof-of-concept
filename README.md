# .NET8.0-Proof-of-concept

**ASP.NET Web API - Proof of Concept with .NET 8**
This is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating key features and best practices in building an ASP.NET Web API using .NET 8.

**Features**
**Repository Pattern**: Ensures separation of concerns and provides a clean architecture for data access.
**Custom Action Filter for Validation**: Handles validation centrally for cleaner and more maintainable controllers.
**Code-First Approach**: Utilizes Entity Framework Core with migrations to define the database schema through C# code.
**AutoMapper**: Simplifies object-to-object mapping, particularly for converting entities to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
**DTOs**: Provides a clean and secure way to expose data to the API consumers.

Please feel free to reach out if additional files or details are required for this POC.
